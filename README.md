# Dr Quine

A puzzle project with the concept of Quine and re-creating quines based off the requirements stated in the PDF


There are three Quines that we need to implemented
* Colleen
	* Must have a main function
	* Must have two diff comments
	* One comment must be inside the main
	* One must be outside of the program
	* A second function is required that must be used
* Grace
	* No main declared
	* Three defines only
	* One comment
	* Must be ran by calling a macro
* Sully
	* Starts at index 5, must create a copy of itself called Sully_X.c where X = value
	* Value will decrement upon each creation
	* The only difference between copies is where integer is decrementing from 5..0
	* Must have somewhere in code clearly where that specific integer is declared for evaluation purposes


I chose to do C, ASM, Python and Ruby. The Python and Ruby are bonuses, and also done as a Oroboros style as well. I enjoy puzzle so this was more for fun then anything else.
